# Java JDBC Transaction System

A Java JDBC–based transaction handling system demonstrating **ACID properties**, **manual commit/rollback**, **deadlock prevention**, and **transaction history logging** using MySQL.

## Features
- Fund transfer between accounts
- Manual transaction control using JDBC
- Commit & rollback handling
- Deadlock prevention using ordered row locking
- Transaction history logging (SUCCESS / FAILED)
- MySQL row-level locking with `FOR UPDATE`

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JDBC
- MySQL
- SQL Transactions

## How It Works
1. Validates sender and receiver accounts
2. Locks rows in fixed order to prevent deadlocks
3. Checks sufficient balance
4. Performs debit & credit in a single transaction
5. Commits on success, rolls back on failure
6. Logs transaction history

## Learning Outcomes
- JDBC transaction management
- Deadlock prevention strategy
- Real-world database consistency handling
